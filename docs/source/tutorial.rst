GLANET Tutorial
===============

GLANET includes both graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface.
In either case, to run GLANET, one should write the following basic command on Terminal (Linux or Mac OS X) or on Command Prompt (Windows)\*::

	$ java -Xms4096M -Xmx8192M âˆ’jar ~path/to/GLANET.jar

Note that we ask you to allow GLANET to allocate 8GB of memory in order to make use of all GLANET facilities.

\* Throughout the guide, we will use ~path/to/GLANET.jar to indicate your absolute path to GLANET.jar

GLANET provides Annotation by enabling user to annotate given genomic intervals w.r.t. ENCODE regulatory elements,
predefined gene sets such as KEGG Pathways, user defined gene sets and user defined library.

Other facilities of GLANET includes Enrichment Analysis and Regulatory Sequence Analysis.

1)	**Input File Name**: (Mandatory)

	You have to provide input file which contains user given genomic intervals.
	Assume that Data.zip is extracted under a directory called tool.
	Then sample input data can be reached from ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/.

2)	**Input Format**: (Mandatory)

	GLANET supports input formats such as *dbSNP IDs*, *BED*, *GFF3*, *1-based coordinates (End Inclusive)* and *0-based coordinates (End Inclusive)*.
	For the user given input file, Input Format has to be selected accordingly.

	* *dbSNP IDs*
		-  Sample input data for dbSNP IDs can be reached at
		| ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/CVD_rsIDs_Mediation.txt,
		-  Input Format must be selected as dbSNP IDs.

	* *BED*
		-  Sample input data for BED can be reached at
		| ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/
		| CVD_Mediation_0BasedStart_EndExclusive_GRCh37_p13_coordinates.bed,
		-  Input Format must be selected as BED.

	* *GFF3*
		-  Sample input data  can be reached at
		| ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/
		| CVD_Mediation_0Based_Start_End_GRCh37_p13_coordinates.gff3,
		-  Input Format must be selected as GFF3.

	* *1-based coordinates (End Inclusive)*
		-  Sample input data  can be reached at
		| ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/
		| OCD_GWAS_SNPs_chrNumber_1Based_GRCh37_p13_Coordinates.txt,
		-  Input Format must be selected as 1-based coordinates (End Inclusive).

	* *0-based coordinates (End Inclusive)*
		-  Sample input data  can be reached at
		| ~path/to/tool/Data/demo_input_data/
		| test_interval_data_K562_Usf2_0based_GRCh37_p13_Coordinates.txt,
		-  Input Format must be selected as 0-based coordinates (End Inclusive).



3)	**Assembly**: (Mandatory for *BED*, *GFF3*, *1-based coordinates (End Inclusive)* or *0-based coordinates (End Inclusive)*)

	GLANET supports two assemblies.

	* *GRCh38*
		-  GRCh38 is also known as hg38
	* *GRCH37.p13 (hg19)*
		-  GRCh37.p13 is also known as hg19

	If *BED*, *GFF3*, *1-based coordinates (End Inclusive)* or *0-based coordinates (End Inclusive)* is chosen as Input Format, then Assembly has to be set as either GRCh38 or GRCH37.p13.
	In case of dbSNP IDs, there is no need for Assembly selection.

4)	**Glanet Folder**: (Mandatory)

	Set the Glanet folder (e.g.:  ~path/to/tool).
	Please note that Glanet folder has to be the parent of Data folder (e.g.:  ~path/to/tool/Data).

5)	**Annotation, Overlap Definition, Number of Bases**: (Mandatory)

	For Annotation, set the number of bases for overlap definition.
	e.g: Setting number of bases as *3* means that two intervals are accepted as overlapped if and only if at least 3 bases of these intervals overlap.
	Default is *1* in order to handle the case where the SNPs are given as input data.

6) 	**Annotation, Annotation Options**: (At least one of the Annotation Option has to be checked)

	* *DNase Annotation (CellLine Based)*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. ENCODE provided DNaseI hypersensitive sites.

	* *Histone Annotation (CellLine Based)*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. ENCODE provided Histone modifications sites.

	* *Transcription Factor (TF) Annotation (CellLine Based)*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. ENCODE provided Transcription Factors (TFs) binding sites.
		
	* *Gene Annotation* 
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. clade: Mammal, genome: Human, assembly: Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19),  RefSeq Genes.

	* *KEGG Pathway Annotation*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. KEGG Pathways in exon-based, regulation-based and all-based manner.

	* *TF and KEGG Pathway Annotation*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. Transcription Factors binding sites and KEGG Pathways in exon-based, regulation-based and all-based manner.
		This is a joint annotation which means that given interval has overlapped with TF  and KEGG Pathway intervals, and these TF and KEGG Pathway intervals also overlap with each other.
		Here same TF with different cell lines are pooled.
		
		In other words, joint annotation requires trio overlaps.

	* *TF and KEGG Pathway Annotation (CellLine Based)*
		-  Check this check box, if you want to annotate given intervals w.r.t. Transcription Factors binding sites (CellLine Based) and KEGG Pathways in exon-based, regulation-based and all-based manner.
		This is a joint annotation which means that given interval has overlapped with TF and KEGG Pathway intervals, and these TF and KEGG Pathway also overlaps with each other.
	
		In other words, joint annotation requires trio overlaps.
		
	* *User Defined Gene Set Annotation*

		   	-  RNA NUCLEOTIDE ACCESSION (e.g.: NM_001294255)
			-  Choose the appropriate Gene Information Type. (e.g: Choose GENE SYMBOL if you have loaded GO_gene_associations_human_ref.txt as User Defined Gene Set Input File.)

		-  Name (Optional)
			-  You can give a name for the User Defined Gene Set (e.g.: GO)
			-  Default Name is *NoName*.

7)	**Enrichment**: (Optional)

	* *Perform Enrichment*
		-  Check *Perform Enrichment* check box if you want Enrichment Analysis.
		   GLANET will accomplish Enrichment Analysis for the elements checked in Annotation Options.
        -  Perform Enrichment With ZScores (Default) 
		-  Perform Enrichment Without ZScores 
		-  Perform Enrichment With ZScores (Default) ranks elements w.r.t. their zScores in addition to their empirical, Bonferroni corrected and Benjamini Hochberg FDR adjusted p values.
		-  Perform Enrichment With ZScores requires more memory than Without ZScores and it is recommended when you have at most thousands of elements to be analysed.
		-  Perform Enrichment Without is recommended when you have hundreds of thousands of elements to be analysed (e.g. In case of Cell Line Based TF and KEGG Pathway Analysis).
		-  Do not check Perform Enrichment With ZScores if you have hundreds of thousands of elements and you don't have enough memory (> 16GB)
		        
	* *Generate Random Data Mode*
		-  With GC and Mapability (default)
		-  Without GC and Mapability

	Choose the *Generate Random Data Mode* which can be either *With GC and Mapability* or *Without GC and Mapability*.
	Default is *With GC and Mapability*.

	* *Multiple Testing*
		-  Benjamini Hochberg FDR (Default)
		-  Bonferroni Correction

    Select the *Multiple Testing* procedure which can be either *Bonferroni Correction* or *Benjamini Hochberg FDR*.
	In fact, GLANET performs both of the Multiple Testing procedures but results are sorted w.r.t. the selected Multiple Testing procedure.
	Default is *Benjamini Hochberg FDR*.

	* *False Discovery Rate (FDR)*
		-  Default *False Discovery Rate (FDR)* is 0.05.

	* *Bonferroni Correction Significance Criteria*
		-  Default *Bonferroni Correction Significance Criteria* is 0.05.

	* *Number of Permutations*
		-  Choose the *number of permutations* among 5000, 10000, 50000 and 100000 choices.
	Start with smaller number of permutations, and increase number of permutations depending on your computer's performance.


	* *Number of Permutations In Each Run*
		-  Choose the *number of permutations* in each run among 1000, 5000 and 10000 choices.
	e.g.: Do not forget that increasing the number of runs increases the GLANET execution time.
	If your system properties are good such as CPU and RAM, prefer minimum number of runs.
	You may have 10000 permutations, by achieving 10000 permutations in each run, which makes 10000/10000 = 1 run at total.
	Or you may have 100000 permutations, by achieving 10000 permutations in each run, which makes 100000/10000 = 10 runs at total.

8)	**Regulatory Sequence Analysis**: (Optional)

	Please note that Regulatory Sequence Analysis is enabled if you have checked at least one of the following Annotation Options such as *TF*, *TF and KEGG Pathway* or
	*TF and KEGG Pathway (CellLine based)*.
	If you want to carry on Regulatory Sequence Analysis, you must check the RSAT check box.
	Please notice that Regulatory Sequence Analysis  is carried out for all of the annotated Transcription Factors.
	Regulatory Sequence Analysis makes use of RSAT web services.

9)	**Job Name**: (Optional)

	Please give a job name, then a directory named with this job name will be created under ~path/to/tool/Output/JobName/.
	Choose shorter job name so that all the sub folders to be created under ~path/to/tool/Output/JobName/ directory will not exceed the allowable length.
	Default is Job Name is  *NoName*.
	
**Log File**:
	
	GLANET run from GUI (by double clicking the GLANET.jar) will be logged in a log file. Log file will be saved under the same directory where the GLANET.jar resides.

GLANET Command-Line Interface and Command-Line Parameters
---------------------------------------------------------

In the following table, commands and their prerequisite commands, if any, are specified. A command is required if and only if its precondition command(s) is specified. Command IDs distinguish options between each other. You must at most set one option per ID. For example, if you set both -f0 and -fbed, the program will terminate by giving an error message. Details of the commands with examples are specified below. Note that command "-c" (1) indicates that GLANET will run in command-line, not with GUI.
