GLANET Data Driven Computational Experiments
============================================

In order to assess the statistical power and Type-I error control of GLANET, we designed data-driven computational experiments using large collections of ENCODE ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data. 
These experiments indicated that while GLANET enrichment test often performs conservatively in terms of Type-I error, it has high statistical power.
