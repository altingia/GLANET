GLANET User Guide
=================

GLANET includes both graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface. In either case, to run GLANET, one should write the following basic command on Terminal (Linux or Mac OS X) or on Command Prompt (Windows)\*::

	$ java âˆ’jar ~path/to/GLANET.jar -Xms8G -Xmx8G

Note that we ask you to allow GLANET to allocate 8GB of memory, if necessary. Therefore, even if you want to use the GUI, it is crucial to run GLANET.jar with this way.

\* Throughout the guide, we will use ~path/to/GLANET.jar to indicate your absolute path to GLANET.jar
